<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ðŸ“ƒ About The Project
This is a transportation management system that manages drivers orders and customers. Using this platform, the admin will be able to keep track of a customer's deliveries using an optimized algorithm to generate the shortest path (Vehicle Routing Problem) , calculate a truck's speed and predict the remaining road time. Also, another optimized algorithm will be deployed in order to manage a truck's load (freight) based on bin-packing problem.  <br>


 ### ðŸ“œ Project Main features
1. **Customer's management**
2. **Real time truck tracking** 
3. **Truck management** 
4. **Customer management** 
5. **Freight management** 
6. **Order management** 
7. **Drivers management**
